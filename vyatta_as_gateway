Configuration of Vyatta interfaces
Below are the commands to configure the vyatta uplink interface eth0 

# configure                             - Enter into configuration mode
# set interfaces ethernet eth0 address <IPAddress of the management>
# set interfaces ethernet eth0 description <UPLINK>
# set interfaces ethernet eth0 speed auto             - Link speed
# set interfaces ethernet eth0 duplex auto             - Duplex mode
# set interfaces ethernet eth0 smp_affinity auto         - CPU interrupt affinity mask

Configure the downlink interfaces eth1, eth2, etc..
# set interfaces ethernet eth1 address <IPAddress of the VMnetwork>
# set interfaces ethernet eth1 description <VMnetwork>
# set interfaces ethernet eth1 speed auto             - Link speed
# set interfaces ethernet eth1 duplex auto             - Duplex mode
# set interfaces ethernet eth1 smp_affinity auto         - CPU interrupt affinity mask

Configure the System
Below are the commands to configure the uplink gateway and the nameserver. 

# set system gateway address <gateway of the uplink>
# set system name-server 8.8.8.8 or <any dns the customer wants to add>

Configure the source NAT Rule
Below are the commands to configure the Source NAT rules. It allows to send traffic from the VM network to Uplink.

# set nat source rule <rule_number 1-9999>
# set nat source rule <rule_number> description <source NAT rule>
# set nat source rule <rule_number> outbound-interface eth0
# set nat source rule <rule_number> source address <IPaddress>
In the above command IP address can be in any format of the below. 
<x.x.x.x>        IP address to match
<x.x.x.x/x>          Subnet to match
<x.x.x.x>-<x.x.x.x>    IP range to match
!<x.x.x.x>           Match everything except the specified address
!<x.x.x.x/x>         Match everything except the specified subnet
!<x.x.x.x>-<x.x.x.x>     Match everything except the specified range
# set nat source rule <rule_number> translation address <IPaddress or masquerade>
In the above command IP address can be in any format of the below.
<x.x.x.x>        NAT to the specified IP address
<x.x.x.x>-<x.x.x.x>    NAT to the specified IP range
<x.x.x.x/x>          NAT to the specified network address. Host part of the address will remain unchanged

Configure the Destination NAT Rule
Below are the commands to configure the Destination NAT rules. It allows the receive traffic from UPLINK IP (floating IP address) to the VM network IP address or one VM.

# set nat destination rule <1-9999>
# set nat destination rule <rule_number> description <destination NAT rule>
# set nat destination rule <rule_number> inbound-interface eth0
# set nat destination rule <rule_number> destination address <Floating IP address>
In the above command IP address can be in any format of the below. 
<x.x.x.x>        IP address to match
<x.x.x.x/x>          Subnet to match
<x.x.x.x>-<x.x.x.x>    IP range to match
!<x.x.x.x>           Match everything except the specified address
!<x.x.x.x/x>         Match everything except the specified subnet
!<x.x.x.x>-<x.x.x.x>     Match everything except the specified range
# set nat destination rule <rule_number> translation address <IPaddress or masquerade>
In the above command IP address can be in any format of the below.
<x.x.x.x>        NAT to the specified IP address
<x.x.x.x>-<x.x.x.x>    NAT to the specified IP range
<x.x.x.x/x>          NAT to the specified network address. Host part of the address will remain unchanged

Configure the firewall
We are creating two default firewalls in Vyatta to handle the inbound traffic and local vyatta traffic effectively. The ‘vyatta_firewall’ handles the inbound traffic to the DNAT rules.

# set firewall name <vyatta_firewall> default-action 'drop'
# set firewall name <vyatta_firewall> rule 10 action 'accept'
# set firewall name <vyatta_firewall> rule 10 state established 'enable'
# set firewall name <vyatta_firewall> rule 10 state related 'enable'

The below are the local vyatta firewall configurations.

# set firewall name <vyatta_local> default-action 'drop'
# set firewall name <vyatta_local> rule 10 action 'accept'
# set firewall name <vyatta_local> rule 10 state established 'enable'
# set firewall name <vyatta_local> rule 10 state related 'enable'
# set firewall name <vyatta_local> rule 20 action 'accept'
# set firewall name <vyatta_local> rule 20 icmp type-name 'echo-request'
# set firewall name <vyatta_local> rule 20 protocol 'icmp'
# set firewall name <vyatta_local> rule 20 state new 'enable'
# set firewall name <vyatta_local> rule 30 action 'accept'
# set firewall name <vyatta_local> rule 30 destination port '22'
# set firewall name <vyatta_local> rule 30 protocol 'tcp'
# set firewall name <vyatta_local> rule 30 state new 'enable'
# set firewall name <vyatta_local> rule 40 action 'accept'
# set firewall name <vyatta_local> rule 40 destination port '80'
# set firewall name <vyatta_local> rule 40 protocol 'tcp'
# set firewall name <vyatta_local> rule 40 state new 'enable'


Configure the firewall groups
There are three types of groups. 
Address-group     -creates a group of IP addresses
Network-group     -creates a group of network address (cidr only)
Port-group         -creates a group of ports

Below are commands to configure the groups
# set firewall group address-group <name> address <IP address>
<x.x.x.x>        IPv4 address to match
<x.x.x.x>-<x.x.x.x>    IPv4 range to match (e.g. 10.0.0.1-10.0.0.200)

# set firewall group network-group <name> network <x.x.x.x/x>

# set firewall group port-group <name> port <port_number>
<name>           Named port (any name in /etc/services, e.g., http)
<1-65535>        Numbered port
<start>-<end>              Numbered port range (e.g. 1001-1050)

Assign the firewall groups to firewall rule
# set firewall name <vyatta_firewall> rule 30 action accept
# set firewall name <vyatta_firewall> rule 30 destination group port-group <port_group_name>
# set firewall name <vyatta_firewall> rule 30 source group network-group <network_group_name>
# set firewall name <vyatta_firewall> rule 30 state new enable
